## 🌐 Web Application (`/web`)

**Purpose**: Desktop/web-based interface for administrators and encoders to manage the receipt system from computers.

**What it's for**:
- **Admin Management**: Full system control, user management, analytics
- **Encoder Operations**: Receipt issuance, template management, bulk operations
- **Desktop Access**: Better for data entry, reporting, and administrative tasks
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Linux through web browsers

**Technology Stack**:
- React.js with JSX
- Vite build system
- CSS3 with modern styling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## 📱 Mobile Application (`/mobile`)

**Purpose**: Mobile-first interface for encoders and viewers to use the system on-the-go.

**What it's for**:
- **Field Operations**: Issue receipts during events, meetings, or on-site
- **QR Code Scanning**: Use device camera for receipt verification
- **Mobile Payments**: Process payments through mobile payment gateways
- **Portable Access**: Work from anywhere with mobile devices

**Technology Stack**:
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Navigation for mobile navigation
- Native device features (camera, storage, etc.)

## 🔑 Key Features

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Admin Role**: Full system access, user management, analytics
- **Encoder Role**: Receipt issuance, template management, transaction processing
- **Viewer Role**: Receipt verification, payment gateway access, read-only operations

### **Receipt Management System**
- **Digital Receipts**: Generate official receipts with unique numbers
- **QR Code Integration**: Each receipt gets a scannable QR code for verification
- **Template System**: Customizable receipt templates for different purposes
- **Transaction Archive**: Complete history of all receipts and payments

### **Payment Gateway**
- **PayMongo Integration**: Secure online payment processing
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers
- **Automatic Receipt Generation**: Receipts created automatically after successful payments

### **User Experience Features**
- **FAQ Chatbot**: Interactive help system for users
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy-to-use interface for all user types
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization across platforms

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control

### **Quick Start**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Recetra_
   ```

2. **Start Web Application**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Web app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Start Mobile Application**
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm install
   npx expo start
   ```
   Use Expo Go app to scan QR code and run on mobile device

### **Using Batch Scripts (Windows)**
- **`Start Both Servers.bat`**: Starts both web and mobile servers simultaneously
- **`Start Web Server.bat`**: Starts only the web application
- **`Start Mobile Server.bat`**: Starts only the mobile application
- **`start-dev.bat`**: Alternative startup script with development settings

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User Input → Authentication → Role Verification → Feature Access → Data Processing → Storage/Display
    ↓
Receipt Generation → QR Code Creation → Email Delivery → Payment Processing → Transaction Recording
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **Web Development**
- Edit files in `/web/src/`
- Use `.jsx` extension for React components
- Styles in `/web/src/styles/`
- Run `npm run build` for production build

### **Mobile Development**
- Edit files in `/mobile/src/`
- Use `.tsx` extension for TypeScript components
- Assets in `/mobile/assets/`
- Run `npx expo start` for development

### **Shared Assets**
- Place common images, icons, and resources in root `/assets/` folder
- Both applications reference this shared folder
- Maintains consistency across platforms

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Accounts**
| Role | Username | Password | Access Level |
|------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Admin | admin | password | Full system access |
| Encoder | encoder | password | Receipt management |
| Viewer | viewer | password | Read-only access |

### **Testing Scenarios**
- **Receipt Issuance**: Create receipts with different templates
- **QR Code Verification**: Scan generated QR codes
- **Payment Processing**: Test payment gateway integration
- **User Management**: Add, edit, and manage user accounts
- **Role Permissions**: Verify access control for different roles
